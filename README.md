- Read detailed information of each product, including code, price, brand, company, and an image of the product.
- Update the information of an existing product in the inventory.
- Delete a product from the inventory.
- Perform searches by price and by product code.
- Perform advanced searches that combine different search parameters.

## Technologies Used

- C# as the programming language.
- .NET Framework for desktop application development.

- SQL Server for data persistence.

## Important Practical Information

- The database generation script is included in the project. If you need to modify the database structure, be sure to update the corresponding script.
- If you are using a version of SQL Server different from the one used in the project development, you may need to update the connection string in the application configuration.
- The application has been tested on Windows 10 environments. You may experience issues if you try to run it on earlier versions of Windows.
- If you encounter any issues or have any suggestions for improving the application, please do not hesitate to contact the development team.
